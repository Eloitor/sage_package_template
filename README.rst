A Cookiecutter for Sage projects
================================

This Cookiecutter generates a simple `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org>`_ package
example to serve as a good practice reference for package developers. We follow
python recommendations and adapt them to the SageMath community. You can find more
advanced documentation on python package creation on
`How To Package Your Python Code <https://packaging.python.org/>`_.
